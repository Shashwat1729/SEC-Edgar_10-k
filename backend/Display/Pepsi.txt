Pepsi's return on common equity (ROE) has generally been higher than that of Coca-Cola and Nike over the past 27 years.
Pepsi's ROE has been especially strong in recent years, with the company achieving double-digit ROEs in each of the past five years.
This strong ROE performance is likely due to a combination of factors, including Pepsi's strong brand portfolio, its efficient cost structure, and its focus on innovation.
