Nike's ROE has been the lowest of the three companies over the past 27 years.
Nike's ROE has also been more volatile than that of Pepsi and Coca-Cola.
In recent years, Nike's ROE has been improving, with the company benefiting from strong demand for its products in both developed and emerging markets.
However, Nike's ROE is still below that of Pepsi and Coca-Cola, which suggests that the company has more work to do in order to improve its profitability.
